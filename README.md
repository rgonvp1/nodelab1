Prefered to search for a package that helps in the task, iterating over a file to format data is not the point here, it is to understand the use of node and npm

Found csvtojson package, wich is flexible enough to parse csv from different sources, I've chosen the file option

through the iteration, added objects to an array and in the end, flushed the array to a file after stringify it. 

Quite simple.
